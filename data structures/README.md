# Data-Structures
The purpose of this project is to show my understanding of data structures. 
The program has the super 'Shoe' class and subclasses 'Boot', 'Heel', and 'Sneaker'. The program's main function is to read the given text file and identify 
each item in the file as the appropriate object type. Then, it "writes" the object into another file where it is clearly def consists of a catalogue-like system 
where each object is placed in a catalogue and the program displays the appropriate description, similar to a catalogue.
