# ICS4U
This repository contains the various programming exercises I completed in Grade 12 Computer Science, ICS4U. This includes data structures, algorithms, recursion, and documentation. 

Data Structures

This includes classes, objects, and reading and writing from a text file 

Algorithms

The program has a simple class with a constructor, two instance variables of different data types, and at least two methods to access the instance variables. 
The main part of the program uses selection sort to sort an array of at least 75,000 objects. However, it only outputs the first and last 20 items in the array. 
Then, the linear and binary search algorithms search through the sorted data. 

Recursion

I designed two simple and effective recursion algorithms. In Recursion-1, I created an algorithm that counts down twice from the given number. In Recursion-2, I created an algorithm that extracts the evenly divisible numbers from an array. 

Documentation 

This program is primarily a review of the concepts learned in Grade 11 Computer Science. This includes if statements, for loops, while loops, functions with and without user input, and arrays/lists.
